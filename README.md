# The-Invisible-Hand
### Quick Disclaimer
Yes, I am aware that this prorgam can be used maliciously. However, I started this program because I like the cybersecurity aspect of it and wanted to challenge myself to see how well I could make this work. As with any other piece of software, always make sure you have permission to run this on a computer before doing so.

### Some Background
A revamp/restart of my [CC](https://github.com/NatAug62/CC) project. This project was my first major attempt at making a remote takeover program, but was far too buggy and messy for me to manage. I tried restarting this project before, but lost motivation before making any significant progress.

This idea for this project is to create remote takeover program. The program will function similar to using Windows Remote Desktop or TeamViewer, but in a more offensive manner.

### Goals
* Functionality  
  * [ ] Remote connection from client (zombie) to server (controller)
  * [ ] Access to command line on zombie computer
  * [ ] File transfer between controller and zombie
    * [ ] Upload to zombie
    * [ ] Download from zombie
  * [ ] Remote desktop view/control of zombie
    * [ ] Video feed of zombie's screens
    * [ ] Control zombie's mouse
    * [ ] Control zombie's keyboard
* Keep code organized, readable, and documented
* Fix bugs from old version of the project (assuming they carry over)
